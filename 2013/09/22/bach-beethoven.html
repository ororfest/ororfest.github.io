<p>The Brahms Wagner feud is taken to a new level of analysis when scrutinized under synesthesic responses to their musical shapes. <a href="http://blog.research-club.org/?p=148512961">Mathmusician Robby Kraft</a> and artist and synesthete <a href="http://wunnan.com">NÃ­m Wunnan</a> team up to explore the concepts and relationships behind this analogy. Kraft will abstract musical shapes from representative works and illustrate the way these shapes evolved and changed as they were assimilated by the next generation. Wunnan will describe (and paint) the same structures through the lense of his grapheme &gt; color and visual &gt; audio synesthesia. Together the two  interpretations of the musical structures will support a dialogue about the nature of tranlsation and what matters in music and art.</p>
