#What's the big idea?

[XOXO](http://xoxofest.com) brings lots of amazing people to Portland, where, it just so happens, even more amazing people live. OROR is both a chance for visiting doers and thinkers to overlap with residents as well as a way for us Portlanders to get to know each other better.
