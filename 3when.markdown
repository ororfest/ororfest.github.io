##WHEN to book

Want to make sure XOXO attendees can come to your event? Here's your guide.

* *Thus & Fri 9/19 & 9/20* -- First two days of festival. Festival and conference ticket holders will be free during the day.
* *Saturday & Sunday 9/21 & 9/22* -- Daytime - conference attendees will be in talks, but festival attendees will be free.
* *Monday 9/23 and after* -- XOXO encourages attendees to stay an extra day, but no guarantees. Portland continues to exisist, long live Portland!

*Isn't that all a little soon?*

Sure, but this is Portland, land of DIY and collaboration.
