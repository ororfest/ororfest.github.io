##In town for [XOXO?](http://xoxofest.com)
    OROR is your chance to go off-campus and meet some of the most interesting people and projects in the city you're visiting.
    
##From Here?
#Come rub shoulders with fellow Portlanders and talk about what matters to us at the intersection of art, design, technology and local politics. *Got something to say?* We'll have a *calendar* up soon where you can host your own event.
