#Who's running this?
You are. Do you have a project or a cause you care about, that you want to share with other Portlanders, or the most adventurous of the XOXO crowd? Host your own event and put it on the calendar. *8/20 - calendar launching soon!* If you have an idea but not a venue, contact [info@ororfest.com](mailto:info@ororfest.com) If you have a venue but not an idea, contact us too!

<br>
The idea for OROR spontaneously generated between organizers of [Hack Oregon](http://hackoregon.org/), [Community Supported Everything](http://www.communitysupportedeverything.org/), and [Research Club](http://research-club.org/). They are pushing the snowball forward, but you can and should get involved!
